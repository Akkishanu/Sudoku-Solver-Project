Sudoku Solver Project
In this project I created a puzzle game named “Sudoku” which is a logic-based combinatorial number-placement puzzle game.
The objective of the game is to fill a 9 × 9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3 × 3 subgrids that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.
I used Backtracking algorithm to find the correct number at correct position.
